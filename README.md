also included in [the level editor warehouse](https://github.com/solaristheworstcatever/The-Level-Editor-Warehouse) or solars repo if thats what you call it

you can use these for whatever but if you edit them ask first (and also i'll want to put them in here)

has a discord (dm rwslugcat on discord for the link, sorry about this had some issues)

you can edit any tiles provided here as long as you ask first :) (oh and i am allowed to add it in)
