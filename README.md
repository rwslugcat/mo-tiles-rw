i like making tiles and people need tiles so this exists
also included in [the level editor warehouse](https://github.com/solaristheworstcatever/The-Level-Editor-Warehouse) or solars repo if thats what you call it
you can use these for whatever but if you edit them ask first (and also i'll want to put them in here)
